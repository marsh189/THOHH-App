The House on Haunted Hollow is a children's book I was assigned to create a mobile application for in Unity. This was my first Non-collegiate project done in Unity. The work was divided between me and one of my friends (with me taking the lead as I had more knowledge of Unity at the time).

We had two mini games that each of us took lead on. I took charge in creating a tile matching game. This game is simple with the objective being to match face down tiles together. There were different difficulties and the option to have it be timed for a more challenging experience.

I also took the lead on the main functionality of the book, such as swiping the pages, adding animations to the pages, and timing the audio narrations if they were turned on.

Lastlty, I was the main contributor to getting the menus working properly as well as setting up the In-App purchase for the "gold" tier.
